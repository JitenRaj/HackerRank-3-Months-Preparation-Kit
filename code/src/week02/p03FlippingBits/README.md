# Problem : Flipping Bits

You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits (```0 -> 1``` and ```1 -> 0```) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

- Take 1 for example, as unsigned 32-bits is 00000000000000000000000000000001 and doing the flipping we get 11111111111111111111111111111110 which in turn is 4294967294.

Sample Input :

    3
    2147483647
    1
    0

Sample Output :

    2147483648
    4294967294
    4294967295
