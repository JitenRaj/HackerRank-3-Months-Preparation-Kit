# Problem : Pangrams

A pangram is a string that contains every letter of the alphabet. Given a sentence determine whether it is a pangram in the English alphabet. Ignore case. Return either pangram or not pangram as appropriate.

Example :

    s = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

The string contains all letters in the English alphabet, so return pangram.
